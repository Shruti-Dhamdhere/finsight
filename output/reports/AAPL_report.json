    "thesis": "Apple represents a high-quality core holding trading at an attractive entry point following recent underperformance. The combination of fortress balance sheet, exceptional cash generation ($106B FCF), and best-in-class margins (27% net, 47% gross) provides a solid foundation despite premium valuations. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions with potential bounce forming, while the $293 analyst price target offers 11% upside with limited downside given strong fundamentals and support levels.",
    "bull_case": "Apple's exceptional financial profile with 152% ROE and massive cash generation enables aggressive capital returns while maintaining market leadership, with technical oversold conditions setting up a favorable risk/reward entry point. Strategic supply chain investments and reclaiming the SMA 20 level could trigger momentum reversal, driving the stock toward analyst targets near $293.",
    "bear_case": "Recent underperformance versus SPY (11.8% vs 18.6%) reflects concerns about core business maturation and competitive pressures from Samsung in key European markets. High debt-to-equity ratio of 103% combined with premium valuation multiples leave minimal room for execution missteps or margin compression in a weakening consumer environment.",
